DISCLAIMER:

This is a project that i started 5 years ago, it was made for educational purposes and i've used it for years.
Now that i stopped using it, i decided to share it.

***It may not work out of the box because i edited some files manually to remove some blocks of code, this is provided as-is.

FEATURES:

* The keylogging is fully functional, however, it's in PT keyboard layout, and i won't change it for another, should be fairly easy for you to do so.
* It has remote command feature, that's a little primitive and simple but i didn't need anything else, it query's a txt file.
*It spawns an hidden window (has to because of Clipboard hook)
*Has both Clipboard Logging and application (window) changing logging, A.K.A Window Title.
*Has an auto-updater that functions pretty much the same way the command feature.
*Detects windows events (shutdown, logoff, suspend, etc)
*Collects plenty of system info, should be fairly easy to costumize.
*The command feature also has a "Process Management" section that let's you make all kinds of process manipulation with the permissions the application has, read up the source to know how it works.

**Had some other features which were removed for this commit, but you may add anything else you need in this.
